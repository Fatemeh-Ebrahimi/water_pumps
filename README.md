## Project Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the functionality status of water pumps in Tanzania based on factors like location, water quality, management structure, and technical specifications. It addresses the challenge of identifying functional, repair-needed, and non-functional pumps to enhance maintenance and ensure access to clean water for communities.

## Project Goals
1. Develop classification models to predict three target classes:
   - Functional water pumps
   - Water pumps that need repair
   - Non-functional water pumps
2. Analyze which factors most strongly influence water pump functionality
3. Create geospatial visualizations to communicate findings effectively
4. Deploy a simple dashboard to showcase models and insights

# üìä Initial Data Exploration & First Impressions  

## ‚úÖ Dataset Overview
- The training dataset contains **59,400 rows** and **40 features**.
- A separate labels file includes the `status_group` target column (pump functionality).

## üßæ Data Types Summary

| Type     | Count | Description                             |
|----------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| `object` | 30    | Categorical or string-type columns      |
| `int64`  | 7     | Integer columns (e.g., year, region)    |
| `float64`| 3     | Float columns (e.g., coordinates)       |


## üß† Key Observations from `.describe()` and `.head()`

- **Skewed distributions** observed in  `amount_tsh`, `population`, and `construction_year` features.
- **Zero values** in `gps_height`, `longitude`, and `latitude` likely indicate **missing or invalid data**.
- `num_private` appears to have **mostly zero values**, and may be **dropped** if uninformative.
-  Most features are **categorical (`object`)** ‚Äì 30 out of 40 columns
-   Repetitive features like `extraction_type`, `extraction_type_group`, and `extraction_type_class` might offer **redundant information**
  
### üìå Summary
- The dataset has **less unique information than it first appears**
- Careful handling of missing values, feature selection, and encoding will be needed before modeling
- Geospatial features (lat/lon) offer opportunities for external enrichment like weather or population data
- 
## üß† Observations from visualizing variables
- Some regions seem to have much better luck than others
- `quantity` could be a useful binary (enough, else), or even three?
- `management_group` does not seem to have an effect on the distribution. Nor does `permit`
- `quality_group` does not seem to bring much, as there are probably not enough "bad" observations. Similar with `waterpoint_type_group` (maybe?), `extraction_type_class`
- There's a strong case for a binary `payment` variable. Also `source`
- The watershed variabe `basin` might be good but may simply reflect seasonality captured in `quantity`
- 
## üó∫Ô∏è Geospatial Visualization

We created a basic geospatial map of water pumps across Tanzania using `geopandas`.

### Key Steps:
- Used the shapefile from https://www.nbs.go.tz/statistics/topic/gis
- Cleaned the pump data by removing rows with missing latitude or longitude
- Converted the cleaned data into a GeoDataFrame
- Plotted pump locations over a population-colored map of Tanzania
# Data cleaning and preparation

### üßº Missing Value Handling: Construction Year

- Replaced invalid `0` values in `construction_year` with `NaN`
- Imputed missing values in three steps:
  1. Used **median construction year** per **region + installer** combination
  2. For remaining missing values, used **region-level median**
  3. For any still missing, used the fallback: `recorded_year - 5`, based on data distribution
- This strategy filled all 20,709 missing entries using a context-aware approach
## üßº Missing Value Coordinate: `longitude` and `Longitude`
During data preprocessing, we identified a large number of water pumps with invalid or highly suspicious latitude values, such as -2e-08, which caused them to appear far outside of Tanzania‚Äôs geographic boundaries. Initially, we attempted to impute these missing GPS coordinates using grouped medians based on geographic features such as region, district_code, ward, and lga. However, this approach resulted in many identical coordinate clusters that still fell outside the Tanzanian borders.

To ensure the spatial integrity of the dataset, we ultimately decided to remove all rows with invalid or missing latitude/longitude values. Specifically, latitude values outside the valid range for Tanzania (between -15 and 0) or extremely close to zero (i.e., abs(latitude) < 0.1) were treated as invalid and excluded. This ensures that all remaining records represent real, mappable locations within Tanzania.
- Output saved as: `data/cleaned_data_filled_V2.csv` 
### üßº Missing Value Handling: `gps_height`
- Replaced invalid `gps_height` values (‚â§ 0) with `NaN`
- Total filled entries: **21,934** (~37% of dataset)
- Imputed values using a two-step geographic approach:
  1. Median per `basin` (hydrological unit)
  2. Median per `region` (fallback)
-  No values left missing
- Output saved as: 'data/cleaned_data_filled_V3.csv'
- This method ensures geographic consistency by reflecting local altitude patterns

### üßº Missing Value Handling: `population`
- Replaced invalid values (`0`) with `NaN`
- Total filled entries: **21,381** (~36% of the dataset)
- Used a two-step geographic imputation:
  1. Median per `district_code`
  2. Median per `region` (fallback)
- After imputation, all missing values were filled
- As an additional step, we capped population values at **2,500**, based on domain knowledge and national-level population density in Tanzania
  - This avoids skew from unusually large or erroneous values
  #### üìâ Population Clipping
- Capped population values at **1,999** based on:
  - Distribution analysis
  - Realistic rural/urban estimates for Tanzania
- This prevents model distortion caused by a small number of extreme outliers
- Saved before/after distribution plots in `outputs/` folder:
  - `population_distribution_before_clipping.png`
  - `population_distribution_after_clipping.png`

  ## üîç Exploratory Regression Analysis

As part of our initial data exploration, we ran a basic linear regression using `statsmodels` to examine how a few numeric features relate to the functionality of water pumps.

### ‚úÖ What We Did

- Loaded cleaned data from `cleaned_data_filled_V5.csv`.
- Used five numerical features:
  - `amount_tsh` (water availability)
  - `gps_height` (altitude)
  - `population` (population around the pump)
  - `construction_year` (normalized)
  - `num_private`
- Mapped the target variable `status_group` into numeric codes:
  - `2` = functional
  - `1` = functional needs repair
  - `0` = non functional
- Ran an OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression model using `statsmodels`.

### üìä Key Findings

- All features were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
- The most important predictor was `construction_year` ‚Äî newer pumps tend to be more functional.
- The model had a low R¬≤ (~0.05), meaning the features only explain about 5% of the variance in pump status. This is expected, since we're simplifying a classification problem using linear regression.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This was purely exploratory ‚Äî not meant for prediction.
- In future steps, a classification model (e.g. Random Forest) would be more appropriate.
