## Water Pump Functionality Prediction

# Team: 
### Fatemeh Ebrahimi
### Kateryna Ponomarova
### James Donahue

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the functionality status of water pumps in Tanzania based on factors like location, water quality, management structure, and technical specifications. It addresses the challenge of identifying functional, repair-needed, and non-functional pumps to enhance maintenance and ensure access to clean water for communities.

## Project Goals
1. Develop classification models to predict three target classes:
   - Functional water pumps
   - Water pumps that need repair
   - Non-functional water pumps
2. Analyze which factors most strongly influence water pump functionality
3. Create geospatial visualizations to communicate findings effectively
4. Deploy a simple dashboard to showcase models and insights

## Data Description

### Dataset Source
The data comes from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, which aggregates information about water points across Tanzania.
