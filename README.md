## Water Pump Functionality Prediction

# Team:

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the functionality status of water pumps in Tanzania based on factors like location, water quality, management structure, and technical specifications. It addresses the challenge of identifying functional, repair-needed, and non-functional pumps to enhance maintenance and ensure access to clean water for communities.

## Project Goals
1. Develop classification models to predict three target classes:
   - Functional water pumps
   - Water pumps that need repair
   - Non-functional water pumps
2. Analyze which factors most strongly influence water pump functionality
3. Create geospatial visualizations to communicate findings effectively
4. Deploy a simple dashboard to showcase models and insights

## Data Description

# üìä Initial Data Exploration & First Impressions  

## ‚úÖ Dataset Overview
- The training dataset contains **59,400 rows** and **40 features**.
- A separate labels file includes the `status_group` target column (pump functionality).

## üßæ Data Types Summary

| Type     | Count | Description                             |
|----------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| `object` | 30    | Categorical or string-type columns      |
| `int64`  | 7     | Integer columns (e.g., year, region)    |
| `float64`| 3     | Float columns (e.g., coordinates)       |


## üß† Key Observations from `.describe()` and `.head()`

- **Skewed distributions** observed in  `amount_tsh`, `population`, and `construction_year` features.
- **Zero values** in `gps_height`, `longitude`, and `latitude` likely indicate **missing or invalid data**.
- `num_private` appears to have **mostly zero values**, and may be **dropped** if uninformative.
-  Most features are **categorical (`object`)** ‚Äì 30 out of 40 columns
-   Repetitive features like `extraction_type`, `extraction_type_group`, and `extraction_type_class` might offer **redundant information**
  
### üìå Summary
- The dataset has **less unique information than it first appears**
- Careful handling of missing values, feature selection, and encoding will be needed before modeling
- Geospatial features (lat/lon) offer opportunities for external enrichment like weather or population data

## üó∫Ô∏è Geospatial Visualization

We created a basic geospatial map of water pumps across Tanzania using `geopandas`.

### Key Steps:
- Used the shapefile from https://www.nbs.go.tz/statistics/topic/gis
- Cleaned the pump data by removing rows with missing latitude or longitude
- Converted the cleaned data into a GeoDataFrame
- Plotted pump locations over a population-colored map of Tanzania
